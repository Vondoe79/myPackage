An Illustration of Multi-Level Program Directory and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
1. Creating & Instantiating Classes in Python:------|
	² Employee:
		○ The class Instance(s) and/or objects
			§ Use the __init__() method to auto create these each time:
				□ Say the following:
					® First name of employee
					® Last name of employee
					® Salary/income/pay of employee
					® Email address of employee
					® El Cetera
			§ Create other "regular" methods within the class to perform certain "Actions"
				□ Say the following:
					® Full name of employee
					® Annual raise amount of employees' salary/income/pay
					® El Cetera
					® My spin of method addition to this Corey Schafer example. Let's add the following methods to our class (Yet to be implemented):
						◊ Employee education status
							} Continuous education
							} Mature student education
							} Skills gap education
						◊ Employee enrollment types
							} Full time
							} Part time
						◊ Employee program/course enrollment
							} Program of study
							} Courses enrolled in
						◊ Employee grades obtained
							} Pass
							} Fail
						◊ Employee study/learning method
							} Distance/online education
							} On-campus education
						
			§ Set certain global jobs such as "employee number counters" to know the number of employee instances that have been created
				□ Such as
					® The number of employee instances within the class
			§ El Cetera
2. Class Variables:--------|
	² Set the data/attributes/information - Give/assign the above instances/objects "Attributes"/"Instance Variables"/Data/Information
		○ This is basically the data to be used by the code/program
		
3. Class Methods & Static Methods:------|
	² @classmethod decorators can be used as pseudo/alternative constructors/initializers/ or to change some global and/or class variables
		○ Annual raise amount for example
		○ Format some string texts (or raw data/attribute/information) of employee instances before the actual instances are created
4. Inheritance/sub-classing:-------|
	² We can create other sub-classes that could inherit some of the properties of our Employee class for code reusability like:
		○ A "Developer" class or sub-class
		○ A "Manager" class or sub-class
		○ El Cetera
5. Special (Magic/Dunder) Methods; create these for human readable output of your program code:-----------|
	² Say the following:
		○ __repr__()
		○ __str__()
		○ El Cetera
6. Property Decorators:--------|
	² These decorators are used in …
		○ Such as the following:
I am finally on the verge of getting my hands around OOP & Program Multi-Level Directory Structure in Python! Thanks to Corey Schafer & Samuel Atule's free tutorial notes :)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25185551/161838998-ac156aa0-b9ff-4fc6-bdf3-33316457b912.png)
